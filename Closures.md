# Closures in Swift part 2

## 1- Using closures as parameters when return values
- Lets break down `do_operation` function <br>
It takes two parameters:
1. `num` which is an integer number 
2. `operation` which is a closure with no params and returns a `String`

```swift
func do_operation(num: Int, operation: () -> String) {
    print("Op \(num)- \(operation())")
}

do_operation(num: 1) { () -> String in
    return "Hello World!"
}

```
> **Note**
> We are calling `do operation` function with `num: 1` then opening a curly brackets to pass the closure value which is returning "Hello World!" 

another simple way to call `do operation`:
```swift
do_operation(num: 1) {
    "Hello World!"
}
```

## 2- Shorthand parameter names
We just made a `travel()` function. It accepts one parameter, which is a closure that itself accepts one parameter and returns a string. That closure is then run between two calls to `print()`.

```swift
func travel(action: (String) -> String) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")
    let description = action("London")
    print(description)
    print("I arrived!")
}
```

In a normal way, we will call `travel()` like this:

```swift
travel { (place: String) -> String in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}
```

However Swift knows that the parameter to that closure and must be a string and its returning type also <br>so this is allowed:

```swift
travel { place in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}
```

> **Note**
> Moving forward to our topic [Shorthand parameter names](#2--Shorthand-parameter-names):
Swift lets you go even shorter. Rather than writing `place in` we can let Swift provide automatic names for the closure’s parameters. These are named with a dollar sign, then a number counting from 0.

```swift
travel {
    "I'm going to \($0) in my car"
}
```
